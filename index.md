## Welcome to the akorn project
#### a.k.a. my homegrown organic kernel project 

This is a project in which I, C.Monkey (yes that's a pseudonym, of which I have many), the current creator and owner of this repository intend to build my own kernel from scratch.
An auspicious goal to be sure, but it is more of a learning exercise as I'd like to understand the bones of how to build my own operating system, so I might one day use those skills to improve my own life and give back to the open source community.

If it looks a bit sparse right now, thats because this repository is pretty new. I'm currently in the early stages of developing the understanding and requirements to build my own operating system. If you'd like something interesting to view, try [here](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page). I owe those guys a lot, as I'm sure do countless others like me.

And yes to anyone whose taken a look at the base repo, I found the community buttons and was curious about what they do. After all, an opensource project is the ultimate goal here.
