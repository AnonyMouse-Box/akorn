### Pull Requests

Your pull request should include a comment outlining a rough description of the changes that have been made, why they were made and what this adds to the project. Without a comment I am unlikely to approve the request as cannot easily justify if it is the best interests of the project.

That is all for now as the concerns of the project remain relatively simple.
